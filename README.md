A modern Flutter-based store application implemented from Figma UI designs. This repository contains a complete mobile app built with Flutter, following the original Figma screens and layout for a clean, responsive shopping experience.

## Key Features

- Clean, responsive UI built from Figma designs
- Product listing, details, favorites, cart, and checkout flows
- User authentication and profile management
- Category browsing and search
- Notification and order management screens

## Built From
